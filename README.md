# MCP Server for security checking (url, domain, ip address)

A Python library and CLI tool for checking domains, URLs, or IP addresses against a blacklist for phishing and malware threats. Integrated with an always-running MCP server for AI-driven workflows.

## Features

- Check domains, URLs, and IPs against multiple blacklist sources
- Automated daily updates from OpenPhish, PhishStats, and URLhaus
- High-throughput performance with SQLite backend and in-memory caching
- CLI interface for manual checks and batch processing
- MCP server integration for AI-driven workflows

## Installation

```bash
pip install sec-mcp
```

## Usage via CLI

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install sec-mcp
   ```
2. Check a single URL/domain/IP:
   ```bash
   sec-mcp check https://example.com
   ```
3. Batch check from a file:
   ```bash
   sec-mcp batch urls.txt
   ```
4. View blacklist status:
   ```bash
   sec-mcp status
   ```
5. Manually trigger an update:
   ```bash
   sec-mcp update
   ```

## Usage via API (Python)

1. Install in your project:
   ```bash
   pip install sec-mcp
   ```
2. Import and initialize:
   ```python
   from sec_mcp import SecMCP

   client = SecMCP()
   ```
3. Single check:
   ```python
   result = client.check("https://example.com")
   print(result.to_json())
   ```
4. Batch check:
   ```python
   urls = ["https://example.com", "https://test.com"]
   results = client.check_batch(urls)
   for r in results:
       print(r.to_json())
   ```
5. Get status and update:
   ```python
   status = client.get_status()
   print(status.to_json())

   client.update()
   ```

## Usage via MCP Client

To run sec-mcp as an MCP server for AI-driven clients (e.g., Claude):

1. Install in editable mode (for development):
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
2. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   sec-mcp-server
   ```
3. Configure your MCP client (e.g., Claude) to point at the command:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "sec-mcp": {
         "command": ".venv/bin/python3",
         "args": ["-m", "sec_mcp.start_server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Clients will then use the built-in `check_blacklist` tool over JSON/STDIO for real-time security checks.

## Configuration

The client can be configured via `config.json`:

- `blacklist_sources`: URLs for blacklist feeds
- `update_time`: Daily update schedule (default: "00:00")
- `cache_size`: In-memory cache size (default: 10000)
- `log_level`: Logging verbosity (default: "INFO")

## Configuring sec-mcp with Claude (MCP Client)

To use your MCP Server for security checking (sec-mcp) with an MCP client such as Claude, add it to your Claude configuration as follows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sec-mcp": {
      "command": ".venv/bin/python3",
      "args": ["-m", "sec_mcp.start_server"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Ensure you have installed all dependencies in your virtual environment (`.venv`).
- The `command` should point to your Python executable inside `.venv` for best isolation.
- The `args` array should launch your MCP server using the provided script.
- You can add other MCP servers in the same configuration if needed.

This setup allows Claude (or any compatible MCP client) to connect to your sec-mcp server and use its `check_blacklist` tool for real-time security checks on URLs, domains, or IP addresses.

For more details and advanced configuration, see the [Model Context Protocol examples](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/examples).
